Race Condition : Race Condition occurs when two or more thread try to access same resources , based on under lying os threads may get different results
				 such cases nothing but race condition.
				 
Starvation :   Starvation is nothing but one thread it keep on trying to access a resource but it not getting the resource is called Starvation.
	 Starvation describes a situation where a thread is unable to gain regular access to shared resources and is unable to make progress. 
	 This happens when shared resources are made unavailable for long periods by "greedy" threads. For example, suppose an object provides a synchronized method that often takes a long time to return.
	 If one thread invokes this method frequently, other threads that also need frequent synchronized access to the same object will often be blocked.

Deadlock : When tow or more  threads waiting on a condition that cannot be satisfied . Deadlock most often occurs when two or more threads are each waiting
			for the others do some thing.
			
Reentrant : The Java runtime system allows a thread to re-acquire a monitor that it already holds because Java monitors are reentrant. 
			Reentrant monitors are important because they eliminate the possibility of a single thread deadlocking itself on a monitor that it already holds.
