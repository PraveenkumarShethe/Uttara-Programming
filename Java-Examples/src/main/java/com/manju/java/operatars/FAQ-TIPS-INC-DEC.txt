Increment and Decrement Operators 	

Like C and C++, Java provides increment and decrement operators. Specifically, it provides the plus-one increment (++) and decrement (- -) operators. If such an
operator is used in front of a variable reference, then 1 is added to (or subtracted from) the variable and its value is read into the expression. If it is used after a
variable reference, then the value is first read and then the variable is incremented
or decremented by 1. So, for example, the code fragment


assigns 8 to j, 10 to k, 10 to m, 18 to n, and leaves i with value 10.
