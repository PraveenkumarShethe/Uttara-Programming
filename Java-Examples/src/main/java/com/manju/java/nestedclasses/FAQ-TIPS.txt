			
NESTED CLASSES : classes defined Within the Class are called nested Classes.

Nested classes can be further classified in to two types : 1) Inner Classes (Non Static Nested Classes)  2) Static Nested Classes.

So Think of nested classes as a big container with two compartments , one for for Static Nested Classes and second one is for Non Static nested Classes .

Technically Non static nested classes are called INNER Classes in Java.

There are several compelling reasons for using nested classes, among them:

  --> It is a way of logically grouping classes that are only used in one place.
  --> It increases encapsulation.
  --> Nested classes can lead to more readable and maintainable code.  



<!-------------  					NON STATIC NESTED CLASSES OR INNER CLASSES    -------->

 --> The definition of Inner Class Always Available for the outer class to use .(No Inner Class Object Automatically Instantiated by outer Class object) 

 There are three type of Non Static Nested Classes
  
		  1) Member Inner Classes.
		  2) Anonymous Inner Classes.
		  3) Local Inner Classes.
		  
  A) These inner classes can be used in the context of containingclass ( outer class or enclosing class) . 
  
         			----------  Member Inner Classes  -------------	
         			
  A) its just like other class but will have access to all the member variable of Outer Class.
  B) Outer Class will have the access of all the methods of Inner class . (No Worries About method modifiers).
  C) We can create as many as of Inner Class Instance.
  D) OuterNonStaticMemberNested out=new OuterNonStaticMemberNested();
  E) OuterNonStaticMemberNested.InnerNonStaticMemberNested in=out.new InnerNonStaticMemberNested();
  F) If Inner Class Defined with Private Access modifier then we can't create   Inner Class Object Out Side the Outer Class.
  G) If Inner Class Defined with Other than Private Access modifier and have private method , those can be accessed only from  InnerClass objects 
     Created within the OuterClass. we can't access if we create InnerClass Object Outside the Outer Class.
  F) inner class can have private access modifier as we can't provide for Outer Class.
  
  
  
  
  					---------- Anonymous Inner Class  (Anonymous non static nested class -----------        
  	
  	A class that have no name is called Anonymous Inner Class.
  	
  	A) Anonymous Class can be created by  Class (Abstract Class also) or Interface.		
  						
  					---------- Local Inner Class  (Local non static nested class -----------
  					
  		A class created inside the a method is known as Local Inner Classes.( If you want to invoke the methods of local inner classes you must
  		instantiate this class inside the method.
  		
  	A) Local Variables Can't be private / public / protected .
  	B) Local Inner Class can't be invoked from outside the method.
  	C) Local Inner Classes can't be accessed non final local variables.
  	
  	
  			------------------------------- Static Nested Classes -----------------------------------
  			
  		a Static class that is created inside the class in known as Static nested classes.
  		
  	A) it cannot access non static members.
  	B) it can access static data members of outer class including private data members.
  	C) static nested classes can't access non-static (instance) data members and methods.
