############# Object Oriented Design Principles #############

1) Abstraction :


2) Encapsulation :

3) Modularity :



 ----> Abstraction : It represents essential features without including the background details or explanations .
 					 Abstraction tell what each operation does not how it does.
 					 
 ----> Encapsulation :  is a technique used for hiding the properties and behavior of an object and allowing outside access only as appropriate and
 						also prevents other objects from directly altering or accessing the properties or methods of the encapsulated object.
