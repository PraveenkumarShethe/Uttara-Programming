Benefits of Collection Frame Work .

	1) Reduces programming effort.
	2) Increases program speed and quality.
	3) Allows interoperability among unrelated APIs.
	4) Reduces effort to learn and to use new APIs.
	5) Reduces effort to design new APIs.
	6) Fosters software reuse.
	
####################### Interfaces ####################################################

Two type of interface in Collection Frame work
1) Core Collection.
2) Map Interfaces.

 ------ >  Core   Collection Interface 
 1) Collection Interface : 
 2) Set Interface : A collection that cannot contain duplicates.
 3) List Interface : an ordered collection . List can contain duplicate elements.
 4) Queue Interface : a collection used to hold multiple elements prior to processing. beside the basic Collection Operation , A queue provides additional
 	insertion , extraction and inspection operation.
 5) Dequeue Interface : a collection used to hold multiple elements prior to processing . besides the basic Collection , a queue provides additional insertion
 	extraction and inspection operation.
 	
 Dequeue can be used both as FIFO (first-in, first-out) and LIFO (last-in, first-out). 
 In a dequeue all new elements can be inserted, retrieved and removed at both ends
 
 -------------> Map
 Map — an object that maps keys to values. A Map cannot contain duplicate keys; each key can map to at most one value. 
 If you've used Hashtable, you're already familiar with the basics of Map. Also see The Map Interface section.
 
 
 ---------------> Sorted Interface
 
    1) SortedSet — a Set that maintains its elements in ascending order. Several additional operations are provided to take advantage of the ordering.
    	    Sorted sets are used for naturally ordered sets, such as word lists and membership rolls.
    2) SortedMap — a Map that maintains its mappings in ascending key order. This is the Map analog of SortedSet. 
    		Sorted maps are used for naturally ordered collections of key/value pairs, such as dictionaries and telephone directories. 
    		
    		
  Collection Interface Array Operations.
  Object[] a = c.toArray();
  String[] a = c.toArray(new String[0]);
