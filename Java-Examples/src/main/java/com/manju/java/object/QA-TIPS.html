Calling the new operator on a class type causes three events to occur:

•    A new object is dynamically allocated in memory, and all instance variables are initialized to standard default values. The default values are null for
     object variables and 0 for all base types except boolean variables (which are false by default).

• 	 The constructor for the new object is called with the parameters specified. The constructor fills in meaningful values for the instance variables and per
     forms any additional computations that must be done to create this object.

• 	 After the constructor returns, the new operator returns a reference (that is, a memory address) to the newly created object.
     If the expression is in the form of an assignment statement, then this address is stored in the object variable,so the object variable refers to this newly created object.
