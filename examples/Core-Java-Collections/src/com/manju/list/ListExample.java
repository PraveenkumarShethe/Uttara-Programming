Most polymorphic algorithms in the Collections class apply specifically to List. Having all these algorithms at your disposal makes it very easy to manipulate lists. Here's a summary of these algorithms, which are described in more detail in the Algorithms section.
 •sort — sorts a List using a merge sort algorithm, which provides a fast, stable sort. (A stable sort is one that does not reorder equal elements.)
 •shuffle — randomly permutes the elements in a List.
 •reverse — reverses the order of the elements in a List.
 •rotate — rotates all the elements in a List by a specified distance.
 •swap — swaps the elements at specified positions in a List.
 •replaceAll — replaces all occurrences of one specified value with another.
 •fill — overwrites every element in a List with the specified value.
 •copy — copies the source List into the destination List.
 •binarySearch — searches for an element in an ordered List using the binary search algorithm.
 •indexOfSubList — returns the index of the first sublist of one List that is equal to another.
 •lastIndexOfSubList — returns the index of the last sublist of one List that is equal to another.
