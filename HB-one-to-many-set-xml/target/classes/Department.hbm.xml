“inverse”, should change to “relationship owner”?

In Hibernate, only the “relationship owner” should maintain the relationship, and the “inverse” keyword is created to 
defines which side is the owner to maintain the relationship. 
However the “inverse” keyword itself is not verbose enough, I would suggest change the keyword to “relationship_owner“.
In short, inverse=”true” means this is the relationship owner, and inverse=”false” (default) means it’s not.
