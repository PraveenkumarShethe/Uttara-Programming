2)    Aspect-oriented programming
3)    Data access (DAO)
4)    Transaction management
5)    Model-view-controller (Spring MVC)

Application logic Can be Divided in to 2 distinct Areas : 1) Core Business logic and Cross Cutting Concerns.

Aspect : Aspect Defines the Implementation Of Cross Cutting Concern . Cross Cutting Functionality is nothing but utility logic that is agnostic to any
		 specific business process and required by many parts of the application   
	
	There are  two ways to define Aspect in Spring 
	1) Schema Based (Java class and Configuration in spring Configuration file)
	2) Annotation Based : Regular Java Class with @Aspect 
	
An Aspect contains Advice & PointCut

Join Point : The Point Of Execution of program.
			A Specific point in a programs execution where advice is applied ,Advice Can Be Applied Before or After Join Point.
			
Advice : Logic that invoked at a specific point in program execution.

Point Cut : A predicate that matches join point.
